      <h2>Applying and Understanding CSS</h2>
      <p>
        CSS is a code language that can not be of much use on its own. It is
        designed to style and "beautify" your websites so they aren't so plain
        and bland with just you HTML code. CSS stands for "Cascading Style
        Sheets"; that means that your CSS code will style your HTML with
        declarations that identify and style elements in a orderly manner.
      </p>

      <!--This is the ruleset explanation for element tags-->

      <article>
        <p>
          You write CSS by selecting an element by its name: for an &lt;h1&gt;
          tag you would name your declaration h1{} and fill the curly brakets
          with as many declarations as you want.
        </p>
        <div class="example">
          <p>
            <br />h1(my ruleset target){<br />my declaration: my value;<br />}
          </p>
        </div>

        <!--This is the explanation for id and class declarations-->
      </article>
      <p>
        <br />You can use the name of the element or you can give elements names
        and use those. The attribute of class can give lots of elements a name
        that can be styled together. The id attribute can give an element a name
        that can be styled separately from all other classes or element names it
        falls into.
      </p>

      <!--class declarations-->

      <article>
        <p>
          For the class attribute, put a period (.) before the name when styling
          it in your CSS code.
        </p>
        <div class="example">
          <p>
            <br />.MyClass(my ruleset target){<br />my declaration: my value;<br />}
          </p>
        </div>
      </article>

      <!--id declarations-->

      <article>
        <p>
          <br />For the id attribute, put a hash-tag (#) at the begginning of
          your id name in your CSS code.
        </p>
        <div class="example">
          <p>
            <br />#MyId(my ruleset target){<br />my declaration: my value;<br />}
          </p>
        </div>
      </article>

      <!--This is the end-note for applying css-->

      <p>
        <br />That's about it for understanding CSS and the very basics on how
        to use it! Next we will take a dive into the many declarations and
